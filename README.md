This repo is used for testing React web app with [Atatus Browser Monitoring](https://www.atatus.com/browser-monitoring/overview)

### Instructions for testing:

1. Create a test app, after you signup with [Atatus](https://www.atatus.com/signup)

2. Copy the API key that is displayed in the setup and replace it with `YOUR_ATATUS_API_KEY` in the file `public/index.html`

3. Run the app and you should start seeing the metrics captured in your test projects

### How to run and test

In the project directory, you can run:

## `npm install`

This will install the dependencies.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.
See the section about [running tests](#running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!
